## Obstacles

### CSP, CORS, Web workers.

Chrome Extension Protocols

- Chrome extensions use the **`chrome-extension://`**
 protocol for their resources, including worker scripts.

Standard Worker Init

1. Worker script is typically an external JavaScript file hosted on the same origin as the parent
2. Web Worker is instantiated using the URL of the worker script (HTTP or HTTPS protocol).
3. No need to handle CORS restrictions explicitly when loading a worker script from the same origin.
4. MIME type and additional headers are not usually specified when creating the Web Worker.
5. This poses a limited compatibility with Chrome extension environment due to URL protocols and potential CORS issues. ðŸ¥²

Summary:

- Loading worker scripts from a URL may not be feasible or practical due to the extension's unique security model and sandboxing

```jsx
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
```

Current Solution:

1. Worker script is fetched from the Chrome extension resources using **`chrome.runtime.getURL`**.
2. Worker script is converted into a Blob object, which is then used to create a Blob URL with the **`blob:`** protocol.
3. Web Worker is instantiated with the Blob URL, which is considered a same-origin request and bypasses CORS restrictions.
4. Web Worker is configured with a 'module' type and additional headers, such as 'Content-Type', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', and 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods', to satisfy CORS requirements.
5. Enhanced compatibility with Chrome extension environment by addressing URL protocols and CORS issues. ðŸ˜Š

```jsx
const workerResponse = await fetch(chrome.runtime.getURL('workerBundle.js'));
const workerText = await workerResponse.text();
const workerBlob = new Blob([workerText], { type: 'application/javascript' });
const workerUrl = URL.createObjectURL(workerBlob);

const worker = new Worker(workerUrl, {
  type: 'module',
  header: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/javascript',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',
  },
});
```

### Packages in Web Workers.

- ```importScripts()``` - the native process to import external packages in extensions. Caused more cors issues.

My solution to  create WebWorkers in a Chrome extension environment has its advantages, such as bypassing CORS restrictions and compatibility with the extension's URL scheme. However, it comes with a limitation: it's not possible to directly import packages or libraries within the WebWorker due to the way it is instantiated using Blob URLs. ðŸ¤¦

When using a Blob URL to create a WebWorker, the worker script is isolated from the typical JavaScript module resolution mechanism. The worker script, loaded as a Blob, is executed in a separate global context, making it difficult to import external packages or libraries using standard ```import``` statements, as the worker script loses the context of its original location, file structure, and relative paths.

***Constraints*** :
- importing external scripts
- CORS, CSP
-  Needing a CSS lib for parsing stylesheet





 Flat Module Resolution :
- During the build process, esbuild inlines the dependencies and resolves module imports, resulting in a flat output that doesn't include ```import``` statements. Consequently, the final build output has no module dependencies and can be run directly in the target environment without relying on additional module loaders.

```jsx
"build:typescript": "esbuild src/pages/Content/Service/worker.ts --bundle --outdir=src/internalDist --platform=node --target=es6 --loader:.js=jsx --loader:.tsx=tsx --sourcemap --define:process.env.NODE_ENV=\"production\"",
"build:transferWorker": "esbuild src/internalDist/worker.js --bundle --outfile=dist/workerBundle.js --minify --platform=node --target=node12 --watch",
```

Summary :

- I resolved the module dependencies / imports of my needed parser libs so that my Web Workers can run their parsing process on separate threads. I then used webpack to copy the worker build from my internal dist to the final build.
